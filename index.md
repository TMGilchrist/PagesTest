		<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Game</h1>
          <h3><p>Ink’d is a 2D physics based puzzle platformer where you control an octopus, using 2 tentacles to attach to surfaces and swing yourself through levels. Instead of a more traditional WASD movement system that most 2D platformers employ, Ink’d opts for an unconventional system where you click and drag 2 tentacles to surfaces to maneuver around the levels. Doing this you will generate momentum to move quickly and efficiently through levels, swinging past hazards and obstacles.</p><br>

<p>The game will feel chaotic and crazy, it has a high-octane game feel that can enthuse the player and have them wowed as much as possible. The player will feel somewhat out of control in any situation, with objects and themselves flying all over the place.</p><br>

<p>Ink’d features a cartoony aesthetic with slapstick gore and violence. While a common trope in TV it is something that isn’t covered a whole lot in video games and as such it will add an extra layer to the game. The games artistic aesthetic features very cartoony, stylised and caricatured aesthetics with bold toon shading with black outlines, the style is meant to be inherently eye catching and one that will pop out with vibrant colours.</p><br></h3>
